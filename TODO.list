TO DO:
Aggiungere un controllo per gli expire url di stripe per evitare che una persona posa comprare lo stesso slot, dato che il link rimane valido
Aggiungere un controllo sullo stato dell'ordine alla fine su success page
Control the mechanism that create the slots for slots that have wait time after (the user shouldn't see but the merchant yes)
add propriety of service like images, description
add timestamp to inserted appointments to view hom much time is passed and delete the ones that aren't payed
add a success and failure page with cool graphics
manage the errors in a better way and fix some of the error messages
make the code better, fix indentation
view if in index.php we can bypass the form with hidden elements
add the list of payment methods
control if we need api/book.php because i think that we don't need it anymore
add an admin panel with login
implement docker (last thing to do)
